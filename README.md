# Kubernetes-Final-Proj
Kubernetes Final Sprint Senior Design Spring 2019
This project is just an introduction to setting up a simple Kubernetes cluster with a Master Node and one slave node. Ideally I will continue to further work on this project on my spare time and see if there is a way to automate most of the tools that I used. This project was just to see how far I could get and for the most part everything that I wanted to try out was a success with the exception of a few things. Future goals as of right now for this project is to use terraform to automate as much as possible and be able to build more slave nodes around the master node. I as well want to recreate more useful pods that I can and look forward to managing more then one cluster at a time and see how I can get two clusters to function together.
